description: "Migrating from Imperative to Reactive"
speaker: "Nicolas Frankel"
abstract: "The Reactive Programming model is complex to master. It requires a lot of experience to feel comfortable with its API. However, there’s no denying that it fits the cloud ecosystem perfectly. Since on-premises infrastructure is oversized, running a program that executes a couple of additional CPU cycles won’t change anything. On the other hand, you will pay for them if you host the same program on third-party infrastructure. Depending on the number of those cycles, and the number of nodes the program runs on, it can make a huge difference in your monthly bill.
<br/><br/>
In this demo-based talk, I’ll show how to migrate a traditional Spring Boot application that uses WebMVC, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Cache to its Reactive equivalent in a step-by-step process.
