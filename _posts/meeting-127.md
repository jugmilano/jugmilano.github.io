During the Spring lockdown, I had plenty of time to try the latest Quarkus framework on aarch64 architecture. That leads to millions of opportunities in the IT market from a technical standpoint. Moreover, Quarkus native apps require 90% fewer resources to startup as well as at runtime, which perfectly fits into the IoT devices use-cases. During the talk Iâ€™ll show you how to:
<ul>
<li>Setup the environment on an IoT device (RPi) for your Quarkus native application
<li>Compile your application for ARMv8 devices
<li>Run a Quarkus native application in a container on an IoT device
</ul>
