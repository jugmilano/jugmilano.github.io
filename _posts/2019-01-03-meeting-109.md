description: "OOP v̶s̶ and FP"
speaker: "Mario Fusco"
abstract: "Object Oriented Programming dominated the software development landscape in the last decade of XX century and in the first of XXI. In more recent years, even as a consequence of the advent of multicore CPUs, Functional Programming and its principles started attracting more interest, becoming at least equally relevant in our industry. The biggest mistake made by programmers nowadays is considering OOP and FP as two mutually exclusive paradigms. This misconception is also the product of a misunderstanding about what OOP actually means and its founding principles. The biggest pros of OOP are polymorphism and encapsulation while FP strengths are immutabilty and its declarative style, but these features are orthogonal and there's no reason why they cannot coexist in the same program. The final purpose of this talk is twofold: debunking the misconceptions on OOP and showing that OOP and FP are actually complementary techniques that can happily coexist in the same codebase. It is the duty of experienced developers to fill their toolbox with both OOP and FP tools and to know from time to time how to choose and employ the tool that is the best fit for the problem at hand."
bio: "Mario is a senior software engineer at Red Hat working at the development of the core of Drools, the JBoss rule engine. He has a huge experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector. Among his interests there are also functional programming and Domain Specific Languages. By leveraging these 2 passions he created the open source library lambdaj with the purposes of providing an internal Java DSL for manipulating collections and allowing a bit of functional programming in Java. He is also a Java Champion and the co-author of 'Java 8 in Action' published by Manning."
