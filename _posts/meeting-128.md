description: "How to choose your next Technology Stack"
speaker: "Francesco Strazzullo"
abstract: "Java or Kotlin? Or maybe Scala? And are we sure to go with another Monolith or should we use Microservices? These are some of the decisions that every frontend team needs to address when working on a product. Nevertheless, decision-making is a skill that is normally considered unimportant by developers. In this talk, I will show some useful decision-making techniques that are quite useful when making these and other kinds of decisions."
bio: "I’m a developer and consultant @ flowing. I’m also a speaker at tech conferences and meetup. I’m the author of “Frameworkless Front-end Development”. In my free time, I like to relax playing with my Playstation or cooking some strange ethnic dish for my wife."
