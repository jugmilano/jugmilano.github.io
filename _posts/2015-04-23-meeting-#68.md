description: Reactive Programming for a demanding world&#58; building event-driven and responsive applications with RxJava
jugevents: http://www.jugevents.org/jugevents/event/55602
speaker: Mario Fusco
abstract: Reactive Programming is a new programming paradigm providing an higher level abstraction to build event-driven, scalable, resilient and responsive applications. Its main idea is extending the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators allowing to compose those sequences together in a declarative and functional style. In this talk we'll go over reactive programming principles and then dive into implementation level details showing in a live coding session how to develop a reactive application using RxJava, a library for composing behaviors applied to event streams.
bio: Mario is a senior software engineer at Red Hat working at the development of the core of Drools, the JBoss rule engine. He has a huge experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector.
