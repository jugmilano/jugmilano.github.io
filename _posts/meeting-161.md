description: "An accidental conspiracy: how your load generator is lying to you"
speaker: "Andrea Lamparelli"
abstract: |
    In this talk we will discover different types of load generators and how they can silently skew their observations, making us believe our applications behave way better than they really are. This issue, commonly known as Coordinated Omission, has had a significant impact in the past and may still affect many aspects of performance analysis today. To gain a deeper understanding of this problem, we'll see how different load generators react to a simple use case that aims to reproduce the problem. By examining how these tools have responded to the problem, we can enhance our ability to trust and accurately interpret the performance data they generate, ensuring our decisions are based on more reliable observations.
