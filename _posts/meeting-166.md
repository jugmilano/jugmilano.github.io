description: "Debugging your brain: how cognitive bias shapes our practices and how to mitigate it"
speaker: "Andrea Iacono"
abstract: "Did you ever push for a tech choice that backfired? Or been baffled by a bug that, in hindsight, was painfully obvious? 
Why do projects derail despite the best intentions? The culprit might be in your cognitive biases – the invisible mental shortcuts that can make even the sharpest engineers fail. 
This talk dives deep into the world of cognitive biases and their profound impact on software engineering: we'll explore how biases like Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Dunning-Kruger Effect and others silently influence our estimations, design decisions, debugging processes, and team dynamics. 
Through relatable software engineering scenarios, you'll learn to spot these biases in yourself and your team. More importantly, you'll leave with a toolkit of practical strategies to mitigate their influence, leading to more rational decisions."
bio: "Andrea is a software engineer with a broad experience in several industries ranging from e-commerce to industrial automation, from public administration to Web TV / music. His interests are in algorithms, data and AI."
