description: Reactive Programming for a demanding world&#58; building event-driven and responsive applications with RxJava
jugevents: http://www.jugevents.org/jugevents/event/55602
speaker: Mario Fusco
abstract: Reactive Programming is a new programming paradigm providing an higher level abstraction to build event-driven, scalable, resilient and responsive applications. Its main idea is extending the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators allowing to compose those sequences together in a declarative and functional style. In this talk we'll go over reactive programming principles and then dive into implementation level details showing in a live coding session how to develop a reactive application using RxJava, a library for composing behaviors applied to event streams.
bio: Mario is a senior software engineer at Red Hat working at the development of the core of Drools, the JBoss rule engine. He has a huge experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector. Among his interests there are also functional programming and Domain Specific Languages. He is also the co-author of "Java 8 in Action" published by Manning.
