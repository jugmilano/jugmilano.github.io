description: "The Art of Café Scheduling with the PlanningAI Timefold in Java: No more spilled shifts!"
speaker: "Simon Tiffert"
abstract: |
    The world is full of complex planning challenges – whether in construction projects, production, vehicle routing, or, to make it more relatable, in scheduling shifts for employees in a busy café in Milan.
    <br/><br/>
    Imagine a café where you need to balance employee availability and skills with the demands of the business every day. Who can cover the morning or evening shifts? Who has the necessary barista skills? And how do you ensure no one works overtime or violates labor regulations?
    <br/><br/>
    To solve such challenges, Timefold offers a proven, powerful open-source solution in Java. With Timefold, complex planning problems – like our café scheduling – can be easily modeled using POJOs, annotations, and a Stream API.
    <br/><br/>
    In my talk, I will first explain when this solution is particularly useful and how PlanningAI differs from GenAI. Then, step by step, I'll demonstrate how to model and optimize our café’s shift scheduling problem using Timefold. Finally, I’ll show how to integrate it with Quarkus as a cloud-native application, enabling developers to build  planning systems directly in Java.
