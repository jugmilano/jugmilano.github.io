description: Search with Solr. Simple, fast and big data
speaker: Aurélien Mazoyer
abstract: Discover the open source search tool that have already convinced many companies, including big players in the web, and which is hosted by the Apache foundation, Solr. In the first part, Aurelien will be presenting Lucene and Solr, their components, their architecture, their features, and we'll also introduce Solrcloud, its big data scalability system (with a demo if time allows). In the second part, you'll discover the Solr ecosystem (at least parts of it); ManifoldCF which allows for connecting to data sources (with a live demo of content crawling and searching), Hadoop (because you always need big data technologies in a good presentation ;)  ), and Banana for analytics. With this presentation, you'll have all you need to start big projects with big search in it.
