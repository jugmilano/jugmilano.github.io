description: "Agentic AI Patterns with Quarkus"
speaker: "Mario Fusco"
abstract: "This talk explores emerging patterns in Agentic AI system architectures—workflows and agents—highlighting their differences, challenges in testing, and practical implementation. Attendees will gain a theoretical overview and see real-world examples using Quarkus and LangChain4j, though the concepts apply broadly to building and testing sophisticated AI-driven solutions.
There is no universally agreed definition of what an AI agent is. In practice though, several patterns are emerging. 
These patterns demonstrate the coordination and integration of multiple AI services to build sophisticated Agentic AI systems capable of handling intricate tasks. These Agentic Systems architectures can be grouped in 2 main categories: workflows, where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths, and agents, where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they execute tasks. 
Testing these Agentic Systems architectures is a big challenge for the adoption in mission critical scenarios. This is mainly due to their not completely deterministic nature. 
The goal of this talk is to give a theoretical overview of Agentic AI in general and these patterns in particular. We will discuss their differences and range of applicability and show with practical examples how they can be easily implemented and tested. We’ll use Quarkus and its LangChain4j extension, but the concepts are universal."
bio: "Mario is a senior principal software engineer at IBM working as Drools project lead. Among his interests there are also high performance systems and generative AI, being an active contributor of widely adopted projects like Quarkus and LangChain4j. 
He is also a Java Champion, the JUG Milano coordinator, a frequent speaker and the co-author of "Modern Java in Action" published by Manning."
