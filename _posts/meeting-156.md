description: "JVM ergonomics for software engineers"
speaker: "Fabio Arcidiacono"
abstract: |
    Mollie doesn’t have a Java platform team, so software engineers needed to learn how to deal with some basic JVM performance tuning, discovering JVM Ergonomics along the way.
    We'll briefly touch upon a few different aspects of the JVM and how they are managed by default:
    Memory allocation
    Garbage collection
    Active processor count
    We'll go through a real use case that we had at Mollie, the problem we faced, and how some basic knowledge of JVM Ergonomics helped us solve the issue.
bio: |
    Fabio is a Software Engineer at Mollie with professional experience mostly in Java and Kotlin. In Mollie, he works in the Merchant Monitoring domain, and he's also part of a team of engineers working on laying the foundations for Java adoption in the company.
