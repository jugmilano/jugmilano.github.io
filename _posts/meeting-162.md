description: "Hibernate ORM: the modern Object/Relational Mapping framework for Java"
speaker: "Marco Belladelli"
abstract: |
    Discover how Hibernate ORM continues innovating, by constantly adding
    features that collectively improve performance, type safety, and ease of
    use of the library and find out what’s next for the framework’s future.
    Throughout live coding examples and deep dives, discover some of the new features
    already available in a modern Object/Relational Mapping library for
    Java, like efficient database-side generated values retrieval, the new
    @ConcreteProxy annotation for accurate lazy associations proxy type
    resolution and the long requested @Embeddable type inheritance, enabling
    polymorphism for embedded components. Discover how to start using these
    new functionalities and start taking advantage of them right away.
    Finally, you will find a sneak peak into the upcoming major version 7.0 that
    will fundamentally change how your mapping model is interpreted, and
    much more. The presentation will also include links to blog posts and
    documentation to expand on the topics covered.
