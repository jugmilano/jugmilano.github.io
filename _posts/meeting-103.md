description: "Escape from Java"
speaker: "Roberto Orgiu"
abstract: "As an Android developer, you probably have your own long list of libraries and external dependencies that you’ll add to any new project or feature. These are the libraries that help us to write better code by providing functionalities that are not baked into the Java language: JSON parsing, immutability, performing simple asynchronous operations, and much more.
<br /><br />
Nowadays, Kotlin provides most of these out of the box, most of the times with a friendlier and more concise syntax: this means we could eventually get rid of some of these base libraries and have even less Java code in our codebase.
<br /><br />
In this talk, we’ll demonstrate use cases for familiar, much-loved libraries on Android and show how you can use built-in Kotlin language features instead. We’ll also cover a few examples to show how some libraries that you may not have considered yet will perform better in Kotlin than their Java counterparts.
<br /><br />
Join us into this epic journey of refactoring, testing and implementing!"
