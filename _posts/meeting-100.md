description: "Curing you Domain Model Anemia with Effective & Clean Tips from the Real World"
speaker: "Edson Yanaga"
abstract: "Ever seen Service classes with hundreds or maybe thousands of LOC cluttered with validation logic, DAO access and some business code? Tired of getting NullPointerExceptions and having to check everything with if != null? Filled up of recurring bugs that could be prevented by unit tests, but your code is simply too clumsy to test effectively? Then you definitely should check this session.
<br/><br/>
We’ll show how Domain-Driven Design, proper encapsulation, Value Objects, Entities and Aggregates, Repositories can help you solve all of theses problems. Already knew these concepts but never figured out how to proper apply them in production code? We have these answers with a lot of tips & tricks from the real world. Don’t miss this 100% live code session. You’ll never see your objects the same way again."
