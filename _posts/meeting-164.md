description: "Let AI Tune Your JVM: Autonomous Performance for Java App"
speaker: "Stefano Doni"
abstract: "Manual JVM tuning has always been hard, time-consuming, and often guesswork. Now with Kubernetes, even more so - inefficient pod scaling and out-of-memory kills are frequent problems for Java developers.
In this talk, we’ll explore how AI/ML can automatically tune Java applications for maximum performance and cost efficiency — from selecting optimal heap sizes and GC settings to fine-tuning container resources. You’ll see real-world examples of AI-driven optimization delivering faster, cheaper, and more reliable Java workloads — without touching a single JVM flag."
bio: "CTO and co-founder @ akamas.io Stefano is obsessed with performance optimization and drives Akamas vision for Autonomous Performance Optimization powered by AI.
Stefano has more than 20 years of experience in Performance Engineering and led Moviri Research & Development team before co-founding Akamas.
He is a regular speaker at international conferences and in 2015 he won Computer Measurement Group Best Paper Award."
