<br/>company: Canoo Engineering AG http://canoo.com
<br/>biography: Andres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 17 years of experience in software design and development. He has been involved in web and desktop application development since the early days of Java. Andres is a true believer in open source and has participated on popular projects like Groovy, Griffon, and DbUnit, as well as starting his own projects (Json-lib, EZMorph, GraphicsBuilder, JideBuilder). Founding member of the Griffon framework and Hackergarten community event.
<br/>title: Making the Most of Your Gradle Build
<br/>abstract: Maven has been the dominant build tool in the Java space for quite some time now. While it's a proven technology it's certainly aged, there are new and better alternatives out there. Gradle is perhaps the one that's better positioned to succeed Maven as the build tool of choice. Since 2012 Gradle adoption has skyrocketed. Not only do popular and big open source projects, such as Spring and its portfolio, Hibernarte and Groovy, have migrated to Gradle but large enterprises too. Not to forget that Gradle is the defacto build tool for Android applications since 2013.

When not working with Java, he also loves to travel the world — either by plane or motorbike.
<br/>title: When, why and how to CQRS
<br/>abstract: Most of today’s enterprise applications base on a CRUD data model that is simple and straightforward to implement. Another concept of how to model applications is Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) that enables interesting solutions and use cases, especially with rising demands of scalability. In this session I’ll show the concept and benefits of CQRS, to which other buzzwords such as eventual consistency, event-driven architectures and event sourcing it is related and how to realize a CQRS application. The questions whether this concept can be realized with Java EE technology, where the framework already offers solutions and where it has to be extended will be answered. Most of the time will be spent live-coding and examining the 'devil is in the details' cases of both approaches.

He has developed and tuned applications written in C/C++, Smalltalk, and a variety of other languages. Kirk has written many articles and spoken at several conferences on the subject of performance tuning. He helped evolve http://www.javaperformancetuning.com as a resource for performance tuning tips and information. Recently he founded jClarity which is focused on building better performance diagnostic tooling.
<br/>title: Moving to GC1
<br/>abstract: Come Java 9, our beloved mostly CMS collector will be depreciated and the G1GC will replace the Parallel collector as the default. The hype surrounding this massive change that the G1GC is the best collector… ever. Make no mistake about it, G1GC will be much much easier to tune. So, is this real or is it #fakenews. In this session we will explore the reality by looking experiences moving applications from CMS to G1GC in real production environments. The implications aren’t simply about performance. A sub-optimally tuned collector will increase your companies operating cost by 10-20%. We will also explore results from benchmarks that expose potential pain points. and offer some suggestions on what actions can offer some relief.
