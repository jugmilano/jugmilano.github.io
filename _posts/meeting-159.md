description: "Jakarta EE Meets AI"
speaker: "Ivar Grimstad"
abstract: |
    Most of us do not write our own large language models (LLMs). We are
    consuming them, and integrating them into our enterprise applications.
    Ang guess what? Java is the perfect language for this! You don't have
    to learn Python or any other language for your AI integrations.
    <br/><br/>
    This session will explore different options for Java developers and
    how to integrate them into your enterprise Java applications. There
    will be live demos using libraries and tools such as LangChain4J,
    Spring AI, and Jakarta EE.
