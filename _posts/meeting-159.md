description: "Jakarta EE Meets AI"
speaker: "Ivar Grimstad"
abstract: |
    Most of us do not write our own large language models (LLMs). We are
    consuming them, and integrating them into our enterprise applications.
    Ang guess what? Java is the perfect language for this! You don't have
    to learn Python or any other language for your AI integrations.
    <br/><br/>
    This session will explore different options for Java developers and
    how to integrate them into your enterprise Java applications. There
    will be live demos using libraries and tools such as LangChain4J,
    Spring AI, and Jakarta EE.

    What do you need for open source: soft or hard skills?<br/>
    Eclipse Foundation is a partner of SKILLAB, an European project that monitors the demand and supply of skills across the European labor market by leveraging advanced data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. This approach not only identifies current skill gaps but also anticipates emerging needs, empowering Europe to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving employment landscape.<br/>
    In this presentation, we will introduce SKILLAB and explore the importance of soft skills in open-source environments, as well as how open source contributes to the development of hard skills.
