    <b>Cloud pragmatism with Quarkus</b><br/>
    Speakers:  Mario Fusco and  Matteo Mortari, Red Hat <br/>
    As developers, we all want the same thing: getting things done! But, there are so many hurdles in our way that slow us down and make us feel slow. This time is over. Come to see how Quarkus gives you unmatched speed from development to deployment! From zero to Kubernetes in a matter of minutes!  Hot reload in dev mode, dev services avoiding configuring anything, continuous testing, developer UI, Kubernetes deployment in one click, and plenty of other features designed to make the development experience just better. In this talk we will share our experience as a Quarkus user ourselves and as extension contributors. After this talk, you won’t see Java development the same way!<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Deploying a Quarkus application in OpenShift</b><br/>
    Speakers: Alessio Di Michelangeli, Giovanni Galatro,Victor Carrilho, Client Engineering IBM <br/>
    In this track we will go through deploying a containerized application on OpenShift. You will understand the advantages of using orchestrators and how it's easy and fast to deploy, scale and manage cloud-native applications.<br/>
