<br/>
<b>Secrets of Rockstar Developers (and How to Become One!)</b>
<br/><br/>
Being a ‚Äúrockstar‚Äù or a ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù developer is not about being
popular or giving presentations at big events. What sets those
developers apart is the work they do on innovative projects and
initiatives. By working with other great developers, they create a
positive feedback loop that lifts their career into the stratosphere.
The question is: which comes first? Do great developers work on great
projects, or are they made great by the projects they work on? To
learn the secrets of rock star developers, we traveled the world and
asked them directly. This presentation shows you what they did that made
them rockstars. Because no matter what project you are working on
right now, you can take the same path.
<br/><br/>
<b>Tactics and Strategies on software development: how to Reach a successful software</b>
<br/><br/>
Being pragmatic and understanding the tasks are crucial for effectively achieving your activity as a software developer. Unfurtenelly more is needed to acquire successful software. At this point, you need to go beyond and understand the strategy and tactics of the software engineer.
<br/><br/>
Good software is closer to business and needs to be ready to change often. Rewriting the whole system from scratch becomes a real temptation. New shiny solutions like microservices pretend to solve this problem using new technology. But is there any guarantee that this feeling won't come up again after some time?
<br/><br/>
It does not matter if it is a micro, nano, or even atomic service; no new buzzword or trend can help us with this problem.
<br/><br/>
So here's the answer you've been looking for: you must explore multiple tactics and strategies in software engineering practices, such as documentation, testing, domain-driven design, persistence, cloud adoption, and the different design and architecture styles.
<br/><br/>
This interaction will cover the ultimate guide to making the best use of architecture and design to guarantee a better, maintainable, and evolutionary solution. You'll also learn how to avoid complex systems and fight against legacy to achieve the desired innovation with stability.
